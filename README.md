# weather-provider

This Jahia external data provider retrieves data from api.wunderground.com.

Once deployed, it will create a "weather" under the ACME SPACE demo site.
The folder contains a browsable tree of all the US cities and their live weather reports.

 - In order to minimize the number of requests to the API, the default number of cities per states displayed in the tree is limited to 2.
 - You can search for any US city.
 - No view has been implemented in order the display the content.
